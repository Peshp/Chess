# Chess


A web chess application for playing and analyzing games. Built with ASP.NET Core 8, Entity Framework, SQL, Bootstrap and vanilla JS/CSS. The project is a work in progress — core gameplay and UI are implemented, with analysis and real-time play planned.

## Key ideas
- Play chess in the browser with a visual drag‑and‑drop board.
- Track move history and captured pieces.
- Configurable time controls (minutes + increment).
- Session-backed board state and server-side game logic in C#.
- Lightweight UI using Bootstrap and custom CSS/JS.

## Main features
- Interactive chessboard rendering pieces and squares.
- Move submission and server-side validation.
- Move history panel and captured pieces panel (partial views).
- Basic clocks (minutes + increment) with client-side timer logic.
- Board and game state stored and updated via session + EF-backed models.

## Tech stack
- ASP.NET Core 8
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript/CSS
- Server-side session for board state updates
